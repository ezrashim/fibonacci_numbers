# Fibonacci Numbers Calculator (Iterative vs. Recursive Approach)

##Comparison Study##

Fibonacci Series is one of the more popular subjects in understanding recursion. However, in programming a fibonacci method, using recursive approach reveals many [limitations](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18172257/efficient-calculation-of-fibonacci-series). Using `benchmark` method in ruby, we can measure the time that each code takes to run.

## How to Run the Comparison Study

1. Open terminal (for Mac and Linux users) or the command prompt (for Windows users).
2. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
3. Copy and paste below command to the command line:

  ```
  $ git clone https://github.com/ezrashim/fibonacci_numbers.git
  ```
4. Run the iterative calculator by running below command in `fibonacci_numbers` directory:

  ```
  $ ruby fibonacci_iterative.rb
  ```

5. Run the iterative calculator by running below command in `fibonacci_numbers` directory:

  ```
  $ ruby fibonacci_recursive.rb
  ```

6. Compare the real time computation difference between the iterative and recursive approach.
